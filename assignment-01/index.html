            <li><h2>Babel by R.F. Kuang</h2>
                <p>A thoughtful exploration of the historical and present ties between linguistic study 
                    and colonialism, this book made me reconsider my own perspective on my "why" and 
                    "how" of studying language and linguistics in the present and future. The prose 
                    pulls readers into linguistic study in an approachable way without talking down to 
                    those who already know some about the field, while also giving a clear perspective 
                    on the horrors it imparts both within the story's world and in our own.</p>   
            </li>
            <li><h2>Sunrise on the Reaping by Susanne Collins</h2>
                <p>Susanne Collins's writing seems to always be timely and pertinent. She has a strong 
                    voice and manages to include callbacks for fans of the original trilogy without them 
                    feeling cheesy. This book was devastating and (sometimes) entertaining, and it 
                    provides a lot of interesting backstory to a character whose story mirrors Katniss's 
                    in many ways while still feeling fresh and new.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller</h2>
                <p>Though I deeply enjoyed this read, I would not call it particularly fun. Stories from 
                    Ancient Greece are not always known for their levity. It was a deeply heartwrenching 
                    and devastating read, and the resolution, if one can call it that, made the heartache 
                    worth it.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>I'm Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy</h2>
                <p>As someone who grew up on shows like iCarly, I was initially drawn to this book for the 
                    nostalgia of it. While it was interesting to see glimpses into the behind-the-scenes 
                    moments in one of my childhood star's lives, this book was more impactful to me in its 
                    commentary on complicated family dynamics and how success from an outside perspective 
                    may be tearing someone apart on the inside.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>The Maze Runner by James Dashner</h2>
                <p>A break from the tone of the above, this book was another nostalgic pick but much less 
                    devastating. I used to read dystopian YA novels near constantly, but somehow I missed 
                    this one. Finally reading it made me grateful for the wait, as I think younger me 
                    would have missed a lot of the value I got out of this read.</p>
