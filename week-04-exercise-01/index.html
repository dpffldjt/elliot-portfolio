        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />

        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            I vandalized the Wikipedia homepage. I modified the text colour and background colours of essentially the entire page into
            a pink and green theme, which likely does not have the contrast needed to be accessible to read. This kind of test 
            of a visual theme on an existing website can give an idea of what the theme will look like before your own website really 
            has enough content to check, so it seems that it would be useful to look at things like cohesiveness and accesibility.</p> 
        <p> 
            Additionally, I modified the subheading at the top of the page. Wikipedia is a very valuable source of knowledge, and I 
            use it almost daily, but I can't remember a time where it was brought up in school without my teachers immediately reminding
            everyone that it wasn't a valid source for research, and I'd bet a lot of people's first association with Wikipedia is the 
            same.</p>
        <p>
            I found it interesting to try different shortenings of hex codes to see what worked. For example, in Figma, just two 
            digits of a repeating code will work to give the colour you mean it to, but this required three or more. I think this exercise 
            gave me a chance to play around with that kind of shortcut and learn what works by trying rather than searching.
