    <h1>Endangered Languages</h1>
    <main>
        <p>There is something profound to me about the lifecycle of
        language. Communication may be born from necessity, but people 
        naturally attach cultural and personal identity to their languages.
        While it is natural for languages to evolve, change, and even 
        go extinct, I can't help but mourn what we lose, especially when 
        it is due to something artificial or avoidable.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to participate in preserving and sustaining threatened
        languages in the future. I have seen how Hawaiian came back from
        the brink and now flourishes, and I believe there is still hope 
        for the same in Jeju.
        </p>
        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My research interests include Korean historical linguistics as 
            well as the documentation and preservation of Jejueo, the language
            of Jeju Island in South Korea.</p>
            <p>By working to preserve Jejueo, we maintain the living knowledge of 
            native speakers. This not only supports the preservation of the unique 
            culture developed in conjunction with the language; it facilitates 
            understanding of the historical languages that became the modern Koreanic
            languages as Modern Korean's only historical relative.
            </p>
        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>Experiencing firsthand a place where English, as the dominant 
            language, and indigenous languages could thrive together without one 
            crowding the other out convinced me that there was still hope for other
            languages to be preserved.</p>
            <p>Below, you will find an overview of my two main languages of interest, 
                past and present.</p>
