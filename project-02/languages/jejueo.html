        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Through establishment as Tamna, an independent country, in 
        the first century AD, to alliances with kingdoms on the peninsula, 
        subjugation to the Mongols, and finally annexation in the 14th 
        century, Jeju island has had a long history of cultural development 
        apart from the mainland of Korea. Shortly after that annexation,
        in the Joseon era, Korean speakers are recorded saying the 
        language of Jeju is largely unintelligible to them.
        </p>
        <p>This distinction between languages was only strengthened by the 
        Joseon era policy of isolation of the island. For almost 200 years, 
        up to 1825, the residents of the island were isolated, even restricted
        from leaving. Isolation like this leaves a people to develop their 
        language without outside influence, and it was fertile soil for further
        linguistic divergence from the language being used on the 
        peninsula.<a class="footnote-inline" href="#fn1">&sup1</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The State of Jejueo</h2>
        <p>In the modern era, the official policy of South Korea is that 
        Jejueo is a regional dialect of standard Korean. There is little 
        acknowledgement of it as its own language and only minor governmental 
        support for preserving it.<a class="footnote-inline" href="#fn1">&sup2</a>
        </p>
        <p>While there is still hope for revitalisation, this hope dwindles 
        each day, as we lose more and more of the remaining native speakers.
        Without greater research, and especially institutional support, this 
        language that holds so much cultural and academic value may simply be 
        lost to time.
