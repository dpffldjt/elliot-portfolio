        <h2 id="History">A Brief History of the Hawaiian Language</h2>
            <p>In the Kingdom of Hawai‘i, literacy was greatly emphasised, and
            the literacy rate was as much as 90% in the late 19th century. 
            When the US government overthrew the Hawaiian government, 
            the institutions that facilitated these high literacy rates was
            dismantled. Less than 100 years later, only 32 children spoke 
            Hawaiian.
            </p>
            <p>With great effort and community support, the language then underwent
            a massive revitalisation effort, one of the most successful in the 
            world. Grandparents who still spoke the language worked to teach the 
            children, and when those children grew up, they taught their children,
            and today there are immersion schools across the islands and the 
            University offers degrees taught fully in Hawaiian.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1">&sup1</a>
            </p>
        <h2 id="Experience">Revitalisation Makes Waves</h2>
            <p>While the University of Hawai‘i has a strong presence in the Hawaiian
            revitalisation space, it does not limit itself to only Hawaiian. 
            While I was a student there, I took a class specifically on language 
            revitalisation, and I heard about all the varied Pacific languages that 
            graduate students were working to document, preserve, and sustain for 
            future generations. One particular language interest of my professors, and
            incidentally my own, was <a class="inline" href="jejueo.html">Jejueo</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>While not a Pacific language, the University has a well established Korean 
            program. Jejueo, as the closest relative to Korean and an underdocumented 
            endangered language, fit naturally into the research goals of the university. 
            The current circumstances of Jejueo look dire, but the success of the Hawaiian
            revitalisation program proves that languages like Jejueo can come back from dire
            circumstances and thrive.
