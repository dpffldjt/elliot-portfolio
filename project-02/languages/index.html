        <p>There is something profound to me about the lifecycle of
            language. Communication may be born from necessity, but people 
            naturally attach cultural and personal identity to their languages.
            While it is natural for languages to evolve, change, and even 
            go extinct, I can't help but mourn what we lose, especially when 
            it is due to something artificial or avoidable.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to participate in preserving and sustaining threatened
            languages in the future. I have seen how Hawaiian came back from
            the brink and now flourishes, and I believe there is still hope 
            for the same in Jeju.
