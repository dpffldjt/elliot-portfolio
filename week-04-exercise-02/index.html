        <h1>My Song Collection</h1>
        <p>
            This is a collection of songs that have really helped me through hard times in recent years, or just songs I connect
            with emotionally. Some are happier and more optimistic, some are less than happy and more cathartic to me. Overall, I 
            think a lot of them show how the emotional message of a song can be conveyed regardless of language barriers.

                <h2>Alien — Han (Stray Kids)</h2>
                <p class="details">지구에 툭 떨어진 I'm an alien on this earth<br>
                나 홀로 어디에도 속하지 않아 보이고</p>
                <p class="description">It may be cliche, but this song is a helpful reminder that I'm not alone in feeling
                    alone. It's been a common feeling throughout my life, not feeling like I really fit in anywhere. I'm at
                    a point now that I feel like I belong among my friends and family, but I've immigrated to a culture that's
                    not really mine, so I've really put myself back in a place of not being sure how I belong.<br>
                    Han has since released a sort of sequel to this song, called 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEjHFRzv5TY&pp=ygUJaGFuIGh1bWFu">Human</a>, which is about choosing to
                    do difficult things and put yourself in spaces where people don't accept you as you are because of the strength 
                    the people who do accept you give you. I feel like this duology represents my own journey as well, going from 
                    feeling trapped in places I don't belong to choosing that experience for myself.

                <p class="details">조급할 필요 없어 my pace<br>

                <p class="description">
                    This song was basically my main emotional support in my last couple semesters of my first degree. I felt like
                    all my peers were outpacing me, doing better in classes than me, and generally just setting themselves up to be
                    more successful than I could ever hope to be. Now, I'm more aware that people just have different strengths, and
                    I've talked to friends from those classes who ended up saying the exact same thing about me. <br>
                    There's just something about an uptempo, hype song that can bring up your mood no matter what, and the lyrics did
                    a lot to remind me that comparing myself to others was just wasted energy that could be used on actually working 
                    toward those goals I thought others were reaching before me.

                <p class="description">This song is actually a love song. It's about a person who is choosing to love their partner
                    in spite of the uncertainty of the future and reassuring them that they'll be there even through the hard times.
                    It feels a little silly to make this about something much less grand, but this song really encouraged me through 
                    preparing for my tests here in Korea. It became a promise to myself, to give my all and do my best and reassure 
                    myself that I can make it through the difficult times, and that I would come out the other side happy with what I've
                    worked on and what I can still work toward.

                <h2>Amsterdam — Imagine Dragons</h2>
                <p class="details">Your time will come<br>
                If you wait for it, if you wait for it</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The reason Amsterdam is so special to me is not too dissimilar to the previous two. In the second half of college,
                    I found myself needing reminders to be patient and, honestly, realistic about my goals often. There's only so much 
                    you can rush a goal before you're setting yourself up for inevitable failure. I was impatient to graduate, dissatisfied
                    with my own achievements even after graduating early, and upset with myself for not somehow getting a <em>better</em> job
                    than the one I have, even though it was the one I wanted and had worked toward my whole life up to then. This song 
                    then became a reminder that not only will I achieve what I am working toward if I have some patience, but that I have
                    plenty of time to even change my goals entirely.

                <p class="details">Let's run<br>
                어디든 숨막히지 않는 곳으로 가, run</p>
                <p class="description">
                    While the lyrics are somewhat bittersweet, I find this song to be very motivating. The other songs above are 
                    largely reminders that things take time and need patience, this song really reminds me to run toward my goals 
                    with all I have, not only for the sake of achieving the goal, but, as the lyrics say, finding a place where you
                    feel free and can rest.

                    On a much lighter note than the others in this list, this song really just reminds me of a trip I took with my 
                    friends last winter. I'm so grateful to have friends who are spread so far across the world, it enriches my life
                    so greatly, but I do miss seeing them as much as I used to. My friends came to Korea last December, and we spent a
                    week in Seoul and Busan, and I mostly had this song on repeat. Every time I hear it now, it brings me back to the 
                    joy of that trip.
