            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm Elliot. I've long been interested in language, specifically in Korean and its history and related languages.
            Since high school, I've fallen into research rabbitholes often about language learning tools and how they could be
            improved upon, especially as so many languages were and are getting their first modernised online resources even now.
            In college, I took classes about language revitalisation, which frequently touched upon the relationship between
            tech and education, discussing innovations in technology which had the ability to revolutionise language learning,
            especially within those communities which are losing their languages due to circumstances beyond their control.
            <br><br>Since that time, I have been extremely interested in how I can help in the goal of preserving minority and 
            endangered languages and making language resources accessible to and effective for as wide an audience as possible.
            I picked up Computing Applications to further this goal.

                        2025 I received a TOPIK score of 5.

                        develop curriculum for beginner- and intermediate-level elementary school students.

                        There are many resources available for Korean learners, and there are many resources which recommend
                        studying hanja in order to build one's vocabulary in the intermediate stages. However, there are few
                        resources which present this content at an accessible level for learners, and those which do offer a 
                        very limited scope of content.

                        at the moment. Therefore, while this is in my future plans, it is not currently in development.

                    <p class="description">There are several apps made to assist in reading in an L2 to develop one's vocabulary, 
                        but many of theme struggle with parsing Korean text due to the ways that text is spaced and how morphemes 
                        build on core lexemes. Though these do an okay job at achieving their goal, an app built initially for Korean will
                        do a better job at displaying Korean texts and separating words into lexemes, especially without using AI, as many 
                        "contextual" translations using AI end up being wrong.
